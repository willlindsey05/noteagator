description: How to create/edit notes
---
You can create and edit notes using any text editor you prefer. Noteagator does not lock you into a specific editor or format.    
**Example VS Code**  
Open your notebook base in **VS Code**  
```
code -n $(ngt show-base)
```
This opens your notebook directory so you can add or edit .md files easily.  
**Writing Notes**  
Notes can be written in plain text or Markdown. Markdown is recommended for readability and formatting.

You can also add optional **YAML front matter** to your notes to store metadata like descriptions, placeholders, or formatting preferences.   
**Example**
```
---
description: Describe the note
placeholders:
    i: replace me
format: slim
---
my note

```
YAML Front matter must be wrapped between `---` lines at the top of the file.  
For more details, see teh `YAML Front Matter` section.
