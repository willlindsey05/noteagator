description: How to define your notebook
---
Noteagator lets you treat any directory on your machine as a notebook.  
You simply tell Noteagator where your notes are located using the `set-base` command.

---


**Example**  
Consider the following directory structure on your machine:  
```console
$ tree .
.
├── cat_pictures
├── mynotebook
│   ├── coolNote.md
│   └── sub_folder
│       ├── note1.md
│       └── note2.md
└── someFolder
```
To tell Noteagator to use the `mynotebook` directory as your notebook base: 
```console
$ ngt set-base mynotebook
```
You can confirm the notebook base with:   
```console
$ ngt show-base          
/home/kali/temp/mynotebook
```
Once the base is set, you can list your notes:  
```console
$ ngt ls -R    
Notebook Directory: /
  1 📁 sub_folder
    2 📄 note1.md  - some note1
    3 📄 note2.md  - some note 2
  4 📄 coolNote.md  - How to make the best pizza
```
