description: How to copy code snipts
---
Noteagator adds `--copy #` to each code block in your markdown file.  
Example:
```python
# example code to copy 
for i in range(10):
    print(i)
```
Since this is the first code block, you can copy this code snipit with `--copy 1` (`-c 1`) option when running `ngt print`.
