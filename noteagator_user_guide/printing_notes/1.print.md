description: How to print notes
---

The `print` command displays the contents of a specific note. Notes are referenced using a **display index**, which is generated when you run commands like `ls` or `search`.

> The display index is a temporary number assigned to each note in the current listing. You must run `ngt ls` or `ngt search` before printing so you know which index to use.

**Example**  
```console
$ ngt ls     
Notebook Directory: /
  1 📁 printing_notes
  2 📁 yaml_frontmatter
  3 📄 ngt_getting_started.md  - Adding YAML frontmatter
  4 📄 test.md  - test note
  5 📄 test_format.md  - Testing format
                                   
$ ngt print 4 # Prints test.md
